# Hidro-Apps
Hydroponic Installation Monitoring System in Greenhouse Based on the Internet of Thinks.

# Description
This system uses a website interface as a system controller.

The system has the ability to:
- Monitoring Temperature and Humidity in Greenhouses.
- Measure the value of light intensity.
- Monitoring water in hydroponic installations such as water pH value, water temperature, and water turbidity level.
- Automation of lighting for plants.
